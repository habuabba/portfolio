title: Citizen science for data subject driven studies
summary: I am currently working on my PhD research, which focuses on developing a scalable framework using a user-centered approach and UX design techniques for researchers who utilise data subject rights for data collection. This interdisciplinary project involves engaging stakeholders such as policymakers, data controllers, lawyers, researchers, and members of the public to streamline the process of exercising data subject rights for non-experts in compliance with data protection regulations. We are using a research scenario to explore how data subject rights can be used to investigate price discrimination and the audit of medical data. We have conducted a thematic analysis of stakeholder interviews to enhance the design. The work is currently being prepared for publication, so I am able to disclose only some of the prototypes at this time.
