title: Citizen science for data subject driven studies
summary: I am currently working on my PhD research, which focuses on developing a scalable framework using a user-centered approach and UX design techniques for researchers who utilise data subject rights for data collection. This interdisciplinary project involves engaging stakeholders such as policymakers, data controllers, lawyers, researchers, and members of the public to streamline the process of exercising data subject rights for non-experts in compliance with data protection regulations. Authors; Adamu Adamu Habu, Iain Carson and Lan Liu.
