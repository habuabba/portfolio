title: SimpleGrid
summary: SimpleHelp, a company that provides remote support software, is expanding its product range to include a new product. The new product, “SimpleGrid”, will enable clients to set up private computer grids that perform computation-intensive tasks by distributing and running tasks on underutilised machines at any moment. As the product will provide supercomputer-like capabilities to users who may not have used such systems before, the quality and usability of the interface are crucial. Our task is to design an interface that will enable the sophisticated configuration of a potentially complex distributed software-hardware system while making the process and its monitoring simple enough to make the configuration of new tasks and grids worthwhile. Authors; Adamu Adamu Habu, Iain Carson and Lan Liu.
